## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Load and unzip the data from repdata_data_activity.zip. 

```{r}
actrepdata <- read.csv("./activity.csv", header = TRUE)
summary(actrepdata) 
```
Next, check out what the data looks like.

```{r}
names(actrepdata)
```
```{r}
head(actrepdata)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
Daily_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, actrepdata, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```
2. Plot a histogram to show the total number of steps per day.

```{r}
hist(Daily_steps$steps)
```
3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps 
taken per day
```{r}
totalstepsmean <- mean(Daily_steps$steps)
print(totalstepsmean)
```
```{r}
totalstepsmedian <- median(Daily_steps$steps)
print(totalstepsmedian)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") 
of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, 
averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
Interval_steps <- aggregate(steps~interval, actrepdata, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(steps~interval, data=Interval_steps, type="l", col= "red")
```
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
maxsteps<- Interval_steps[which.max(Interval_steps$steps),]$interval
print(maxsteps)
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
(i.e. the total number of rows with \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs)
```{r}
missingvalues<- sum(is.na(actrepdata$steps))
print(missingvalues)
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the 
mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
```{r}
mean_Interval_steps <- function(interval){
  Interval_steps[Interval_steps$interval==interval,]$steps
}
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the 
missing data filled in.
```{r}
NAfree.actrepdata <- actrepdata
  for(i in 1:nrow(NAfree.actrepdata)){
    if(is.na(NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$steps)){
        NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$steps <- mean_Interval_steps(NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$interval)
    }
}
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate 
and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total 
daily number of steps?
```{r}
A.NAfree.actrepdata <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=NAfree.actrepdata, sum)
hist(A.NAfree.actrepdata$steps)
```
```{r}
meanNAfree.actrepdata <- mean(A.NAfree.actrepdata$steps)
print(meanNAfree.actrepdata)
```
```{r}
medianNAfree.actrepdata <- median(A.NAfree.actrepdata$steps)
print(medianNAfree.actrepdata)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and 
“weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
NAfree.actrepdata$date <- as.Date(strptime(NAfree.actrepdata$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
NAfree.actrepdata$day <- weekdays(NAfree.actrepdata$date)
for (i in 1:nrow(NAfree.actrepdata)) {
    if (NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")) {
        NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$day<-"weekend"
    }
    else{
        NAfree.actrepdata[i,]$day<-"weekday"
    }
}
Weekdayorweekend <- aggregate(NAfree.actrepdata$steps ~ NAfree.actrepdata$interval + NAfree.actrepdata$day, NAfree.actrepdata, mean)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged 
across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the 
GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using 
simulated data.

```{r}
names(Weekdayorweekend) <- c("interval", "day", "steps")
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | day, Weekdayorweekend, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
